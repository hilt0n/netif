# Netif

This is a simple Golang package for reading, manipulating and writing the /etc/network/interface file in most Debian based distributions.

This package is heavily based on the Python library **Debinterface** [github.com/dggreenbaum/debinterface](https://github.com/dggreenbaum/debinterface "Debinterface github repository").

## Basic usage
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/hilt0n/netif"
)
```
